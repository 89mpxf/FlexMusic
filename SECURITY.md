# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until FlexMusic enters alpha, and versioning has begun, please refer to the [official FlexMusic repository](https://github.com/89mpxf/FlexMusic) for up-to-date information regarding current security vulnerabilities. At this time, unless stated otherwise by this repository, it is safe to assume that the latest revision of FlexMusic at any given time has implemented the most recent security patches and features.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Upon discovering a vulnerability in FlexMusic and/or the FmLTP protocol, please privately report steps to go about reproducing the vulnerability and its observable effects to [cooper@mpxf.men](mailto:cooper@mpxf.men), or, by drafting a security vulnerability report via the issues tab. If the vulnerability reported can successfully be reproduced, the vulnerability will be publicly reported to the official FlexMusic repository, as well as additional security measures deemed neccesary on a per-occurence basis.
